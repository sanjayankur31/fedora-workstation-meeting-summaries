Summary:

The first ever Fedora Workstation Working Group IRC meeting was held recently on
the 29th of October. The Workstation Working Group is one of the three main
working groups tasked with the creation of the Fedora workstation product, the
other two being the Fedora Cloud and the Fedora Server. The complete proposal,
as explained by Matthew Miller, can be found on the Fedora project wiki here:
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora.next/boardproposal . In short, the default
Fedora product, which the Fedora Desktop Spin is traditionally seen as, will be
replaced by the three aforementioned products. The community's resources: QA,
marketing, others, will then be allocated towards these three products. Note 
that this does not limit Fedora to three products: it merely attempts to 
prioritize these three as core products, or "ring 1". The community is still 
free to produce other products in parallel, in lower priority rings such as 
ring 2, 3, and so on. One practical aspect of these rings is that products 
in rings 2 and onwards can therefore be governed by less stringent policies. 

The Workstation Working Group is composed of 9 members that were chosen by FESCo
from a list of nominees:
- Owen Taylor
- Kalev Lember: 
- Christoph Wickert
- Lukas Tinkl
- Jens Petersen
- Ryan Lerch
- Matthias Clasen
- Christain Schaller
- Josh Boyer

Out of the 9, one member, Josh Boyer, is the liaison to FESCo. Such a liaison is
a requirement of all three working groups and is chosen by FESCo.

[TODO: write a little about each member, and what they bring to the working group]

The formal annoumcement can be found here:

This first meeting aimed at getting all members of the working group up to speed
with recent happenings. FESCo has tasked each working group with two tasks:
- Deciding on their governance model, i.e., how will members be chosen in the
  future, what tenure they serve, how are members that leave replaced, and
such. A first proposal of this governance charter is already under discussion on
the mailing list:
https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/desktop/2013-October/008245.html
Upon completion, it will be placed on the Fedora project wiki.

- Drafting a PRD (Product requirements document). As wikipedia explains, the
  function of this document is to define product itself: it's scope, what
problems it aims to solve, what is required to create this product.

Other than these two tasks, which volunteers from the working group are
now working on, the secondary goal of the meeting was to decide on the channels
that the group would use to communicate. The existing fedora desktop mailing
list (desktop@lists.fedoraproject.org) will be used as the mailing list for the
workstation group. A new IRC channel: #fedora-workstation has been created on
Freenode to be used by people interested in conversing about the product.

In the open floor, the subject of desktop environment sprung up. Members were
interested in discussing whether they'd stick to a single desktop environment
for the workstation product, and what this would mean for other desktop
environments that are available in Fedora. After a short discussion, it was
decided that this will be taken up once the PRD has been agreed on.

The meeting was short and to the point. Since the working group initiative has
only just kicked off, meetings in the future will have more matter to report on.
Do keep an eye out on the meeting-minutes mailing list for future meetings, or
the fedora magazine for meeting summaries.
